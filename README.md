These are some scripts I use to simplify some of my simming. These
aren't intended for production, more like personal notes.

* `load_tmp_fpl.py`: This script will look int a particular folder and load the most recently
  written `*.pln` to the aircraft FMS. Has a lot of cavets because of MSFS support for
  SimConnect functions. See also [here](https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/35#issuecomment-716013932),
  which is the feature I'm actually wanting instead of this scripts.
* `simrate_control.py`: Inspired by the
  [SimRateBandit](https://github.com/dga711/msfs-simratebandit), I wanted the
  functionality more tailored to my own preferences. This may get receive more
  polish and get more intentional sharing in the future.
